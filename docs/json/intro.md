title: Introduction

Every HUD supported by the editor has a dedicated schema file that defines the page layout and instructions for each customization option. This section will act as a reference guide for the structure of said schema file, what control options are available and things to keep in mind as you're building the schema for your custom HUD.

:::note
Use this sample [schema file][json-sample] as a starting point. For reference, also see schemas for [budhud][json-budhud], [flawhud][json-flawhud] and [rayshud][json-rayshud].
